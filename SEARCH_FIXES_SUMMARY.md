# YouTube Search Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Search Performance & Reliability
- **Problem**: YouTube search was slow and unreliable due to fetching detailed info for each video individually
- **Solution**: Now uses basic search results from yt-dlp which is much faster and more reliable
- **Impact**: Search should complete within seconds instead of timing out

### 2. Result Display Issues  
- **Problem**: Blank, vertically truncated list items
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Set minimum height (80px) and maximum height (120px) for result items
  - Added proper padding and margins
  - Improved layout structure with better spacing
  - Added duration display to show more complete information

### 3. Error Handling & Debugging
- **Added**: Comprehensive error handling for search failures
- **Added**: Debug output to track search progress and identify issues
- **Added**: Proper exception handling with user-friendly error messages

### 4. Search Result Information
- **Enhanced**: Each result now shows:
  - Song/video title with numbering
  - Channel/artist name
  - Duration (formatted as MM:SS)
  - Proper visual styling with readable text colors

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Search Process**: 
   - User enters search term and clicks "Search"
   - "Searching..." status appears briefly
   - Results appear as properly sized, non-truncated items
   - Each result shows title, channel, and duration

2. **Result Selection**:
   - Click any result to select it
   - Selected result highlights with colored border
   - Download button becomes enabled
   - Spotify metadata search triggers automatically

3. **Error Cases**:
   - No results: Shows "No results found" message
   - Search failure: Shows detailed error message

The debugging output will help identify exactly where any remaining issues occur during the search process.
