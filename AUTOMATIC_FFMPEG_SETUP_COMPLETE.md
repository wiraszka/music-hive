## Installation Process Flow

### macOS Automatic Installation
1. **FFmpeg Check**: Verify if already installed
2. **Homebrew Detection**: Check for existing Homebrew installation
3. **Automatic Homebrew Install**: If missing, install using official script with NONINTERACTIVE=1
4. **PATH Updates**: Add Homebrew paths to current session
5. **FFmpeg Installation**: Install via `brew install ffmpeg`
6. **Verification**: Confirm successful installation

### Platform Coverage
- **macOS**: Full automatic installation (Homebrew + FFmpeg)
- **Linux**: Automatic installation via apt/yum/dnf/pacman
- **Windows**: Manual installation instructions with detailed steps

- Uses `NONINTERACTIVE=1` environment variable for Homebrew
- Eliminates manual password prompts during setup
- Maintains compatibility with automated deployment scripts

### Real-Time Feedback
- Progress messages during installation
- Clear success/failure indicators
- Detailed error messages with recovery instructions

### Session PATH Management
- Automatic detection of Homebrew installation paths
- Runtime PATH updates for immediate command availability
- Support for both Apple Silicon (/opt/homebrew) and Intel (/usr/local) architectures

## User Experience

### Before Update
```
✓ Python 3.9.6 detected
✓ Running on macOS
⚠ FFmpeg not found - attempting installation...
✗ Homebrew not found
Please install FFmpeg manually:
1. Install Homebrew: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL ...)"
2. Run: brew install ffmpeg
```

### After Update
```
✓ Python 3.9.6 detected
✓ Running on macOS
⚠ FFmpeg not found - attempting installation...
⚠ Homebrew not found - installing Homebrew first...
Installing Homebrew automatically...
✓ Homebrew installation completed
✓ Added /opt/homebrew/bin to PATH
Installing FFmpeg via Homebrew...
✓ FFmpeg installed successfully
```

## Technical Implementation

### Homebrew Installation Command
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

### Environment Configuration
```python
env = os.environ.copy()
env['NONINTERACTIVE'] = '1'  # Skip interactive prompts
```

### PATH Management
```python
homebrew_paths = ["/opt/homebrew/bin", "/usr/local/bin"]
for path in homebrew_paths:
    if os.path.exists(path) and path not in current_path:
        os.environ["PATH"] = f"{path}:{current_path}"
```

## Verification
The automatic installation process has been tested to ensure:
- Homebrew installs without user interaction
- FFmpeg installs successfully via Homebrew
- Download functionality works with audio conversion
- No "ffprobe and ffmpeg not found" errors occur

Users can now run any setup script on macOS and have a fully functional music downloader without manual intervention.
