# FFmpeg Installation Solution - No Admin Required

## Problem
Homebrew installation on macOS requires administrator privileges, preventing automatic FFmpeg setup for users without admin access.

## Solution
Direct FFmpeg binary installation using pre-compiled static builds from evermeet.cx, eliminating the need for Homebrew or admin privileges.

## Implementation

### Direct Binary Installation
Downloads FFmpeg and FFprobe binaries directly to `~/.local/bin/` and adds this directory to the current session's PATH.

### Key Benefits
- **No Admin Required**: Downloads to user directory (~/.local/bin)
- **No Homebrew Dependency**: Uses static binaries instead of package manager
- **Automatic PATH Setup**: Updates environment for immediate availability
- **Cross-Architecture Support**: Works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs

### Installation Process
1. Create `~/.local/bin` directory
2. Download FFmpeg and FFprobe from evermeet.cx
3. Extract and set executable permissions
4. Update PATH environment variable
5. Verify installation works

### Updated Setup Scripts
- `setup_and_run.py`: Enhanced with direct installation
- `auto_setup.py`: Silent direct installation
- `setup_no_admin.py`: New dedicated no-admin setup script

### Usage
```bash
python setup_no_admin.py
```

### Manual Installation Alternative
If automatic installation fails:
1. Visit https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/
2. Download ffmpeg.zip and ffprobe.zip
3. Extract to ~/.local/bin/
4. Make executable: `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/ffmpeg ~/.local/bin/ffprobe`
5. Add to PATH: `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`

### Verification
After installation, verify with:
```bash
ffmpeg -version
ffprobe -version
```

## Code Changes

### Enhanced Downloader Detection
Updated `_find_ffmpeg()` in downloader.py to prioritize user local installations:
- Checks ~/.local/bin first
- Verifies binary functionality before use
- Falls back to system installations

### Direct Installation Function
```python
def install_ffmpeg_direct_macos():
    """Install FFmpeg directly without admin privileges"""
    # Download from evermeet.cx
    # Extract to ~/.local/bin
    # Set permissions and update PATH
```

## User Experience

### Before (Homebrew Required)
```
⚠ Homebrew not found - installing Homebrew first...
Need sudo access on macOS (e.g. the user adamwiraszka needs to be an Administrator)!
✗ Homebrew installation failed with code 1
```

### After (Direct Installation)
```
⚠ FFmpeg not found - installing directly...
Downloading ffmpeg...
✓ ffmpeg installed
Downloading ffprobe...
✓ ffprobe installed
✓ Added ~/.local/bin to PATH
✓ FFmpeg installation verified
```
