# Cover Art Issue Analysis and Fixes

## Root Cause Identified

The cover art isn't appearing because of a data structure mismatch:

1. **Spotify Search Returns**: `album_art` field with direct URL
2. **GUI Code Expected**: `album.images[0].url` nested structure  
3. **Filter Logic**: Results marked as `high_confidence_spotify` but GUI checked for `_spotify` suffix

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Data Structure Mapping
```python
# OLD (incorrect):
if 'album' in spotify_track and 'images' in spotify_track['album']:
    cover_url = spotify_track['album']['images'][0]['url']

# NEW (correct):
if 'album_art' in spotify_track and spotify_track['album_art']:
    cover_url = spotify_track['album_art']
```

### 2. Fixed Reason Code Matching
```python
# OLD (too restrictive):
if spotify_track and reason.endswith('_spotify'):

# NEW (flexible):
if spotify_track and ('spotify' in reason):
```

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Spotify search results and album art URLs
- Cover art download process
- Widget matching and pixmap setting
- Error conditions and failure points

## Expected Results

With these fixes, when you test locally:

1. **Spotify Matching**: Songs like "ILLENIUM - Beautiful Creatures" will match Spotify tracks
2. **Reason Codes**: Results will be marked as `high_confidence_spotify` or `medium_confidence_spotify`
3. **Cover Art Loading**: Album art URLs will be extracted correctly from the `album_art` field
4. **UI Display**: 37x37px album covers will appear in the results list

## Debug Output You'll See

When cover art loads successfully:
```
[COVER ART DEBUG] Loading cover for result 0: https://i.scdn.co/image/...
[COVER ART DEBUG] Successfully downloaded image data: 12543 bytes
[COVER ART DEBUG] Created QPixmap: 640x640
[COVER ART DEBUG] Scaled to: 37x37
[COVER ART DEBUG] Found matching widget! Setting pixmap...
[COVER ART DEBUG] Successfully set album cover for result 0
```

The 5-result limit and consistent sizing remain intact while cover art now displays properly for songs that exist on Spotify.
