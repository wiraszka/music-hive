# GUI Display Fixes for Search Results

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Text Readability
**Problem:** Text was hard to read due to poor contrast between text color and background
**Solution:** 
- Changed result item background from semi-transparent to solid white (#ffffff)
- Updated text colors for better contrast:
  - Song titles: Dark black (#1a1a1a) 
  - Channel names: Medium gray (#555555)
  - Duration: Darker gray (#777777)
- Added proper border styling with light gray (#e0e0e0)

### 2. Layout Overflow
**Problem:** Results list stretched outside app bounds when window was smaller
**Solution:**
- Limited results container maximum height to 300px
- Added proper scroll area with contained sizing
- Reduced individual item height from 80-120px to fixed 60px
- Improved layout margins and spacing

### 3. Unnecessary Image Space
**Problem:** Left side had space reserved for album art that wasn't being used
**Solution:**
- Removed album art placeholder completely
- Redesigned layout to use full width for text content
- Channel and duration now display on same line to save space
- Duration positioned on the right side for better visual balance

## Updated Visual Design

### Result Container
- White background with subtle border
- Maximum height of 300px with scrolling
- Rounded corners and clean styling

### Individual Result Items
- Compact 60px height

### Text Layout
