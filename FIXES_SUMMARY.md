# Music Downloader App - Issues Fixed

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Search Returns "No Results Found" ✓ FIXED
**Problem**: YouTube search was using unreliable web scraping that frequently failed
**Solution**: 
- Replaced web scraping with yt-dlp's built-in search functionality
- Now uses `ytsearch{limit}:{query}` format for reliable results
- Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Search results now include video details like duration, view count, and descriptions

### 2. Quality Selector Text Invisible ✓ FIXED
**Problem**: White text on white background in quality dropdown
**Solution**: 
- Added `color: #333333;` to QComboBox styling in `gui/style.py`
- Text is now clearly visible with dark text on white background

### 3. Directory Change Crashes App ✓ FIXED
**Problem**: Missing method caused crash when changing download directory
**Solution**: 
- Added `update_download_location(new_location)` method to `gui/download_tab.py`
- Method properly updates internal download location and UI label
- Directory changes now work without crashing

### 4. Library Table White Text on White Background ✓ FIXED
**Problem**: Table text was invisible due to white text on white background
**Solution**: 
- Added `color: #333333;` to QTableView styling in `gui/style.py`
- Library table text is now clearly visible

## Files Modified

1. **gui/style.py**: Added text color fixes for ComboBox and TableView
2. **search_youtube.py**: Complete rewrite using yt-dlp search API
3. **gui/download_tab.py**: Added missing `update_download_location` method

## Technical Details

### YouTube Search Implementation
- Uses yt-dlp's `ytsearch{limit}:{query}` format
- Extracts detailed video information including duration, view count
- Proper error handling for failed searches
- Fallback to basic info if detailed extraction fails

### Styling Fixes
- ComboBox: `color: #333333;` ensures visible text
- TableView: `color: #333333;` makes library content readable
- Maintains existing design aesthetic while fixing visibility

### Directory Management
- New method handles location updates safely
- Updates both internal state and UI display
- Prevents crashes during directory selection

## Testing Status
The fixes have been implemented and should resolve all reported issues. The app will need to be tested locally on your Mac to verify functionality since the cloud environment has OpenGL limitations that prevent PyQt6 from running.
